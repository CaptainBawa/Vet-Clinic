## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

# 📖 Vet Clinic <a name="about-project"></a>

**Vet Clinic** is a SQL database project establishes a table called "animals" with columns for ID, name, date of birth, escape attempts, neutered status, and weight in kilograms. The ID column serves as the primary key. This table provides a structured format to store and manage information about animals, including their names, birth dates, history of escape attempts, neutered status, and weight. The project aims to efficiently track and handle animal-related data within the veterinary clinic's operations.
